# sys-monitoring
Linux system monitoring tool in Python:

## Overview

This is a basic system monitoring tool written in Python for monitoring CPU, memory, and disk usage on a Linux system. It uses the `psutil` library to collect system information and can optionally visualize the data using `matplotlib`.

**Note:** This is a simplified example, and production-ready system monitoring tools typically have more features and optimizations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tool, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed on your Linux system
- Required Python libraries installed:
  - `psutil`
  - `matplotlib` (only required for data visualization)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install psutil matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the monitoring tool by executing the following command:

```bash
python system_monitor.py
#or
python3 system_monitor.py
```

4. The tool will display information about CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage on your Linux system.

5. Optionally, if you have `matplotlib` installed, the tool will also display a bar chart visualizing the resource usage.

## Customization

You can customize the monitoring script to suit your needs. For example:

- Modify the monitoring interval in `system_monitor.py` by changing the `interval` parameter in `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` to adjust how frequently the data is updated.

- Extend the script to include additional system metrics or create more sophisticated visualizations.

- Implement logging or alerting mechanisms for more advanced monitoring scenarios.

## Acknowledgments

- This tool is based on the `psutil` library, which simplifies the collection of system information.
- `matplotlib` is used for data visualization, providing a simple way to create charts and graphs.

## Disclaimer

This is a basic example and may not be suitable for production use without further enhancements and security considerations. Always follow best practices when building and deploying system monitoring tools in a production environment.

You can include this README file in your project directory to provide users with instructions and information about your system monitoring tool. Feel free to customize it further based on your project's specific requirements.
